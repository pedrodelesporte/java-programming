# Java Programming — College Coursework

A collection of Java programs I wrote throughout my college Java programming class.  
This repo is mainly labs and projects used to practice core concepts as the semester progressed.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Fundamentals:** variables, conditionals, loops
- **Methods:** parameters, return values, overloading, recursion
- **Data handling:** arrays, ArrayLists, strings
- **OOP:** classes/objects, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Error handling:** exceptions, input validation
- **Files:** reading/writing files 
- **GUI:** JavaFX exercises
  

## Notes

- Some programs depend on **input files** included in the same folder (look for `.txt`, `.dat`, or sample data).
- Not every file is “perfect” — some are early attempts or quick in-class work, and later folders usually show cleaner code.
- Comments are included when they helped me understand the concept or the logic.

## Academic Integrity

If you’re taking a similar course: don’t copy/paste.  
Use this repo to study ideas, compare approaches, and learn the concepts.
